**Project description.** Provide at least one paragraph describing what your project is about: 

We plan to simulate the ultimate 2v2 baseball league. The core of this project will be a function that simulates fielding-independent pitcher v batter match-ups, based on previous statistics. By using retrosheet data and limiting our dataset to players who have played a lot, we can go beyond just judging outcomes based on summary statistics, and instead pick pitches that are characteristic of the situation.


**Project deliverables.** Provide at least one paragraph describing what you plan to produce: 

The main part of this project will be the simulation engine. We will build a library of functions that allow a user to put in a set of teams and simulate a baseball tournament. This set of functions will have the pitcher intelligently select a pitch to throw based on their actual behaviors in similar game situations. Battters will perform according to their performance against similar pitches.

On top of building the actual simulator, we will be running a simulation of the EBL (Eck Baseball League), the ultimate 2v2 cross-era baseball showdown.


**Project submission.** Provide at least one paragraph describing how you plan to submit your final project materials: 

We have a GitHub repo for our project available [here](https://github.com/AidanGlickman/stat430-final). We will be doing all of our work here, as well as writing up a report on the EBL, along with some predictions and analysis.
