## Proposal
We plan to simulate the ultimate 1v1 baseball league. The core of this project will be a function that simulates fielding-independent pitcher v batter match-ups, based on previous statistics.

By using retrosheet data and limitting our dataset to players who have played a lot, we can go beyond just judging outcomes based on summary statistics, and instead pick pitches that are characteristic of the situation.
